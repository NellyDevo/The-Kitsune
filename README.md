# Mod Summary/Intro 

Hi! This is a Kitsune character for Slay The Spire. Wow, who could have guessed?

# Mechanics

## Keywords

 * Aspect
   * She's a Kitsune, right? So she has a human and a Fox form too. Each form gives baseline 'stats', and some cards have effects for specific forms.
 * Will-o-Wisp
   * A non-attack method of damaging. At the end of your turn, each Will-o-Wisp sacrifices itself to do X damage to a random enemy, where X is the number of Will-o-Wisps you summoned that turn
 * Soulsteal
   * A persistent debuff applied to enemies. The first time they attack you on each turn, they grant you an Aspected buff.
 * Shade
   * Negates an instance of unblocked damage and heals you for 2 HP per stack.
 * Light
   * Persistent self buff. At the end of your turn with 9+ stacks, or when you gain Dark, gets consumed to give you that much block.
 * Dark
   * Persistent self buff. At the start of your turn with 9+ stacks, or when you gain Light, gets consumed to deal 2x that much damage to a random enemy.
 * Elder
   * Cards that upgrade up to 9 times based on various conditions instead of in rest sites.
 * Charm
   * Make an enemy assist you with their action instead of target you with it.

# Upcoming Todo

 * Add a minor delay between individual will-o-wisps triggering
 * Replace pearl arts
 * Change Shade mechanic somewhat
 * Simplify starting deck
 * Replace Warm Up
 * Nerf Death Stroke
 * Maybe make Dark do damage to the closest enemy?
 * Write more here - add lore
 * Change Cleansing Nova to be based on the block you gained this turn and not block you currently have for Ancient synergy
 * Make Feeding Frenzy a power
 * Make contextual buff cards yellow outline

Feedback 11/23

 * buff fast shape - 0 and/or draw card
 * rewrite light/dark tooltips and explanation
 * change shape to 0 cost
 * petty theft change upgrade
 * rend spirit sucks - maybe 2 mana 18 take 6?
 * bare fangs change upgrade
 * Plea for guidance and trickster flame redo - too duplicative of ignite
 * ore healing to play missing hp and self harm cards
 * buff flourish for the love of god
 * explicit light/dark feels way weaker than soulsteal
 * swap fox and human aspect effects on lash out
 * ignite gud
 * purifying blaze blows
 * Redo basic aspect cards (ex. test their tactics)
 * add a will o wisp lock on effect? maybe
 * lie in wait: maybe not 6 hp loss on upgrade
 * didnt see enough healing
 * will-o-wisps crashes the game somehow related to dormant awakened one - not EOT, but probably overcapped wisps? Or by overkilled at end of turn extra wisps
 * dominate will: falls off pretty hard as an effect. upgrade should probably raise HP threshhold. Or make it scale via a buff. weak? light? dark? something?
 * maybe make fox and human forms have 1 off-stat to make them not turbo dead in the other type
 * not enough self-weaken, light, or dark cards
 * maybe make change shape part of relic trigger instead of on the thingy?
 * slightly buff blink slash. 
 * "elder is neat but the common elder card is better than the uncommon despite being harder to upgrade because it scales better"
 * "i'd enjoy the cards just do more incidental other stuff"
