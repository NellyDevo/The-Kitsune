# Mod Summary/Intro 

Hi! This is a Kitsune character for Slay The Spire. Wow, who could have guessed?

# Mechanics

## Keywords

 * Aspect
   * She's a Kitsune, right? So she has a human and a Fox form too. Each form gives baseline 'stats', and some cards have effects for specific forms.
 * Will-o-Wisp
   * A non-attack method of damaging. At the end of your turn, each Will-o-Wisp sacrifices itself to do X damage to a random enemy, where X is the number of Will-o-Wisps you summoned that turn
 * Soulsteal
   * A persistent debuff applied to enemies. The first time they attack you on each turn, they grant you an Aspected buff.
 * Shade
   * Intangible but heals you for 2 instead.
 * Light
   * Persistent self buff. At the end of your turn with 9+ stacks, or when you gain Dark, gets consumed to give you that much block.
 * Dark
   * Persistent self buff. At the start of your turn with 9+ stacks, or when you gain Light, gets consumed to deal 2x that much damage to a random enemy.
 * Elder
   * Cards that upgrade up to 9 times based on various conditions instead of in rest sites.
 * Charm
   * Make an enemy assist you with their action instead of target you with it.

# Upcoming Todo
